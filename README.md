# Image-Segmentation

This repository contains the second coursework project from the Computer Vision module of the MSc Computing programme at Imperial College London. It uses a convolutional neural network (U-Net) implemented in PyTorch for segmenting brain tumour images. The project includes steps for preparing the dataset, building and training the model, evaluating its performance, and analysing the results.
